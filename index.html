                        I am a Uganda born in late "90's".A muganda by tribe all because my father is a muganda.My mother on the other side is a munyakole by tribe.
                        All my life people have termed me a munyakole but no am muganda because here in uganda we children adapt to the fathers side till we get married.
                        I love my both cultures alot and treasure them too.
